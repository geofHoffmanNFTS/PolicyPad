        <h1>A Helpful Guide to Policy Pad</h1>
        <h2>What is PolicyPad?</h2>
        <h3>Scratch-Pad</h3>
        <p>PolicyPad gets its name from the yellow legal pads that Iâ€™m sure many of you used or still use as a job-aid
            when
            issuing title policies. It consists of a form that holds all of the information we will need to complete the
            review and issue the policy, a state-specific checklist of review items that can be added to, and buttons
            that
            can be used to store common phrases so that they can be easily copied to the clipboard and we can avoid
            typing
            the same phrases again and again throughout the day.
        </p>
        <h3>Split-calculator</h3>
        <p> PolicyPad also calculates the underwriter premium split based on the split percent stored in state data and
            the
            premium amount and endorsements from the
            rate calculator and has optional fields for check amount verification.
        <h3>Cheat-sheet</h3>
        <p>It also has a text area just below the info fields and above the check verification fields if they are
            visible,
            that displays state-specific data like the underwriter, premium split and CPL amount, if any.
        <h3>Review checklist</h3>
        <p> Policy Pad has a customizable review list that can display as little or as much as a user prefers. The
            state-specific list can be edited from the Edit Menu by selecting "Edit State Data" and updating the review
            items field. File-specific items can be added by entering them in the "Currative Issues/ Review Items..."
            field
            and pressing enter or clicking "Add".</p>
        <p> Each item can be checked-off of the list or removed by clicking the list item or the "X" to the far right of
            the
            list item. When the file is issued ( by pressing "I") or added to the Problem File list ( by pressing "P")
            the
            list is reset. All of the fields (except for the file number) are reset as well as the review list when the
            "Clear All" button is clicked.
        <h3>Copy Buttons/ Special Function Buttons</h3>
        <p> At the bottom of PolicyPad are a group of customizable buttons that can store data so that it can easily be
            copied to the clipboard. Buttons can be added or removed in the Edit Menu by selecting "Edit Copy Buttons".
        </p>
        <p>In addition to copying stored phrases, some buttons have built in special functions. They can still be added
            or
            removed, but if you try to use one in a way it isn't intended, you may get unexpected results. Below is a
            list
            of the Special Function Buttons and their functions:
        <ul>
            <li>LPS- Prepends the file number to " LOAN POLICY SET" and copies it to the clipboard for labeling policy
                set.
                Also, if you hover the mouse over the button, the documents that comprise the policy set, stored in
                state
                data, will be displayed as a tool-tip. </li>
            <br>
            <li>UWS- Prepends the file number to "UW SET" and displays the documents that comprise the UW SET, stored in
                state data.</li>
            <br>
            <li>PPS-Prepends the file number to "PRINT POLICY SET" and copies to clipboard.</li>
            <br>
            <li>JACKET- Hovering over this button display the jacket type saved in state data. </li>
            <br>
            <li>ADDEN- opens a window with a text area to store Addendum text so that it can be formatted, numbered,
                then
                pasted into an addendum or text field.</li>
            <br>
            <li>CHECKS- toggles the "Check Verifier" fields without restarting the app</li>
            <br>
            <li>REVIEW- displays a review note that contains all of the entered data as well as the check status in a
                text
                area with a button to copy it to the clipboard.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>How to Use Policy Pad</h1>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>Policy Pad was build around a simple concept; Gather all the information you need, review your documents,
            then issue the jacket.The info fields provide a convienient way to store all the file-specific information so
            that it is easily accessible, and the calculator functions are a fast and efficient way to confirm check
            amounts. It is not intended to be training tool, but if you hover the mouse over any field, a tool-tip
            displays where the info can be found. </p>
        <h2>File Managment</h2>
        <p>Policy Pad is designed to be used as much or little as you prefer. You can mannually enter a file number into
            the file number field at any to add it to the "Issued files" list or the "Problem" Files list</p>
        <p> You can also pre-load a list of files in by pasting it into the "update Current Files List" window located
            in the "Files" Menu. This is also where you can view or delete files already on the list. The "Issued" files
            list can be used to track your daily production.</p>
        <h2>Problem File Tracking</h2>
        <p>While working on a file, if you find you are unable to issue a file, a status can be typed into the
            "Currative
            issues.." field ( BUT DO NOT ADD IT). By clicking the "P" button, the file, and any data typed in the fields
            will be saved to the Problem File list for follow-up. From the "Files" menu, select "View Problem Files".
            Inside
            this window, you can select any or all problem files and they will be front-loaded to your "Current Files"
            List.
            The next file that will load will be your first selected problem file. If at any time, a file number
            matching a
            file on the Problem File List is loaded, any stored data associated with the file will polulate in the
            corresponding fields.</p>
        <p>Once a problem file has been loaded, the saved status will appear in a new highlighted textArea, just below
            the "Curritive items" Field. The Status can then be edited if the file is not yet ready to issue. Once the
            file is issued, clicking the "I" button will remove it from the problem file list and add it to the Issued
            files list. </p>

        becuase he used steroids." ("Anonymous, 2021) </i>
    <p> This app is not training wheels, it's steriods. It is meant to allow someone who
        understands title, policy production and premium splits, to operate with efficency and produce more with less effort and
        mental fatigue. </p>
